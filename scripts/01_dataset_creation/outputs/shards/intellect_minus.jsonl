The plane needs enough lift to overcome its weight.\n\n3. **Thrust**: This is the forward force created by the engines. It moves the plane forward to help generate lift.\n\n4. **Drag**: This is the resistance that slows the plane down as it moves through the air.\n\nFor a plane to fly, lift must be greater than weight, and thrust must be greater than drag.
